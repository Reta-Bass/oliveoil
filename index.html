       <h2>Mechanism </h2>
       <p> Olive oil contains very important fatty acids and vitamins. It also contains ω3 in low percentage.  Adding  long chain ω3 fatty acids is produced a very nutritional mixture . Thus it is the phospholipids and more particularly phosphatidylserine that  lead the fatty acids in the cellular membrane . Phospholypids combined with fatty acids penetrate  the membrane and strengthen the outer layer or the inner layer of membrane, contributing in the improvement of  resilience and elasticity of cellular membrane.</p>
